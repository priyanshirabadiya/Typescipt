what is the difference between any and unknown in typescript?
let a :any;
let b :unknown;
a.whatever();
b.whatever(); // cause an error
In TypeScript, "any" allows a variable to hold any type of value without type checking, essentially disabling type safety, while "unknown" represents a value of unknown type but forces you to explicitly narrow down its type before performing any operations on it, making it a much more type-safe alternative to "any" when you need to handle potentially unknown data; essentially, "any" says "assume it can do anything" while "unknown" says "check what it is before using it.


What are TypeScript Interfaces?
TypeScript interfaces define the structure of objects by specifying property types and method signatures, ensuring consistent shapes and enhancing code clarity.
Allow for optional and read-only properties for flexibility and immutability.
Enable interface inheritance to create reusable and extendable object structures.
